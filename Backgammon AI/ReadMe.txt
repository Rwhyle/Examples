Final Year Project - Intelligent Backgammon Opponent

Within this folder I placed 3 folders, 
Backgammon Project - This is the visual studios folder with all nesserecery files needed inside

Published - This contains a setup that installs the Backgammon project onto your computer, can be used to test program if your computer does not contain Visual studios

Source Code - A copy of the cs code copied from the visual studios folder, was placed into a seperate folder for easy finding and viewing

Enjoy my Project
